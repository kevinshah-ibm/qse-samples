# Meeting (02/04/2026)

## Updated (02/05/2026)

### Post meeting points to consider:
1. When does the POC start?
- 2 weeks from now
2. GitHub actions + QSE (Integration)
- Assigned to Girish
3. Vibe coding an application
- Need input from client for more targeted code
4. Languages: Primary: Java; Secondary: C/C++, C#, Python, Golang, .net
5. Update the solutions GitHub page with the latest QSE software product - should we reuse (update) the solution-journal-quantum-safe repo or create a new solution doc?
- update the original
    - macOS install instructions updated
6. Explore PassportAdvantage download option (Time limit)
- License or share the package directly through Sharepoint (wait on sales team)
7. Mastercard: What OS are they going to use? Linux or Windows?
- Mac & Windows for now unless the need for Linux really comes up
- Prepare for either: **TODO** download and test all packages on VMs
    - In progress: MacOS tested by Amol & Girish, Kevin testing Windows
8. How should we go about sharing files? Box, OneDrive, etc. - make a folder for this POC?
- Client has access to SharePoint
- Internally we will use Box
9. How many computers to run it on?
- Ask QSE or sales team?
10. Set up standard test repo with all languages
- Can reuse this for all pipelines

### QSE Process
- Help scan repos/files through VS Code
- Deployment scanning (GitHub actions) + dashboard
